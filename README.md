URL2Link takes the current selection and returns either a single MarkDown 
link or an unordered list of them if you pass it a list of links. 
Clip2Link does the same thing but uses a link or links on the clipboard 
as source. Due to the strangeness of Services you will still need a piece 
of text selected and it will be replaced.
